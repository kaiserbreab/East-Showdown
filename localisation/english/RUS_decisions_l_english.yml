We can create informative and engaging commercials that showcase the benefits of contract service and the opportunities to develop a career in the armed forces. Such commercials can be shown on a variety of TV channels and in a variety of formats to draw as much attention to the idea as possible. In addition, we can use television to organize special programs that will focus on military service and the armed forces in general. These programs can include interviews with military experts and veterans who can talk about their experiences of service and draw attention to contract service. Thus, using television to promote contract service in our armed forces can be an effective way to strengthen our country's defense capabilities and attract new qualified personnel to the military."
