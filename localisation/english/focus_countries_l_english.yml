 UKR_The_Last_Line_of_Donbass_Defense_desc: "In the event that the occupant overcomes all lines of defense near the line of contact, it will be necessary to retreat to the last, and strongest line of defense of Donbas near Kramatorsk.

It is unacceptable that they continue to take to the streets in such manner, undermining the confidence of our society in the correctness of the actions of the country's top leadership. It is necessary to disperse all these cowards and traitors! "
 RUS_tv_propaganda: "TV Propaganda"
 RUS_tv_propaganda_desc: "In 2022, with the help of the Internet, everyone can access opinions on any issue from all sides. However, in the current environment, such an approach is not acceptable. The importance of the situation needs to be brought back to the people's attention and the need to maintain the right attitude is needed. To achieve this, we will focus on our TV propaganda team, which has proven itself many times. Their task will be not only to explain our position, but also to provide arguments and facts supporting its correctness."
 RUS_z: "Z"
 RUS_z_desc: "Currently in Ukraine there are events that require a special symbol, which will become a sign of distinction between our supporters and those who do not support the war. We need a symbol that will unite people who are ready to fight for peace and justice in Ukraine. Some people have already taken the Latin letter Z as a symbol, which our army uses along with the letter V to distinguish allied vehicles from enemy ones. We propose to use this symbol unofficially as a sign of the invasion of Ukraine, and encourage propaganda to actively use it."
 RUS_law_on_discrediting_russian_armed_forces: "Law on discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"
 RUS_law_on_discrediting_russian_armed_forces_desc: "Through the efforts of propaganda and the batons of the National Guard, we have not been able to completely silence the voices of those who oppose the decision to invade Ukraine. Therefore, it is necessary to come up with a law prohibiting public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Russian Armed Forces in order to protect the interests of our country. "
 RUS_pay_compensation_to_families_of_deceased: "Pay compensation to the families of the deceased"
 RUS_pay_compensation_to_families_of_deceased_desc: "Our fighters who died doing a just cause deserve respect and recognition for their service. We cannot give them back their lives, but we can do our best to ensure that their families do not need anything. Therefore, we should pay significant compensation to the families of the deceased. We are aware that such payments will have a negative impact on our budget and image, but we believe that this is a small price to pay for the gratitude and respect that we should show our heroes. We must support their families during difficult times and help them get through the loss of a loved one. We hope that our actions will show that we are not just talking about respect for our military, but confirming this with real actions."
 RUS_we_have_no_casualties: "No casualties in the Russian Armed Forces"
 RUS_we_have_no_casualties_desc: "A significant amount of time has passed since the invasion of Ukraine began, and we are still facing enemy resistance. Unfortunately, we are inevitably losing our military, and these losses are a blow to our personnel. We can no longer hide the presence of losses, but also speak honestly. We recognize a small number of casualties among personnel and wounded, and those who will say that their number is much higher, §RWe will silence them!§"
 RUS_appeal_to_images_of_the_past: "Appeal to images of the past"
 RUS_appeal_to_images_of_the_past_desc: "Our ancestors fought for a just cause from the dawn of our country. From the Russian-Byzantine wars to the Great Patriotic War, the people of Russia fought heroically to defend the truth and eradicate evil from the earth. Therefore, we must not forget the greatness of our heroes who served the motherland in different periods of history, but still help the truth to defeat the lies that the current Kiev regime speaks. Today we are again struggling with a hotbed of warfare and Nazism, our people must rely on past generations, because they all defended our borders and truthfulness. As the great Novgorod prince Alexander Nevsky said - "God is not in power, but in truth!""
 RUS_point_strikes: "Point Strikes"
 RUS_point_strikes_desc: "In order to avoid coordinated opposition from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we will launch targeted missile strikes on their military facilities and infrastructure, knocking out their airfields, air defenses, radar stations and other key facilities that allow them to coordinate their actions. Besides, maybe then they will realize that the resistance is useless? "
 RUS_take_zmiiniy: "Take Zmiiniy"
 RUS_take_zmiiniy_desc: "The capture of Snake Island and the further deployment of our air defense forces, coastal defense and cruise missiles on it would allow us to dominate the northwestern part of the Black Sea. In addition, in the context of a potential amphibious landing on the Ukrainian coast, the island can serve as a bridgehead, a place for deploying fire support equipment, and as a radar base. We need to send our Marines there immediately and occupy it!"
 RUS_advance_to_kherson: "Advance to Kherson"
 RUS_advance_to_kherson_desc: "Kherson is a large city located in the southern part of Ukraine, which is of great strategic importance. Its capture will allow to gain a foothold on the left bank of the Dnieper and move forward to Nikolaev and Odessa. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly occupy Kherson, while avoiding urban battles as much as possible. This will save time, effort and resources of our army and accelerate the completion of our goals."

 RUS_civil-military_administrations_desc: "The establishment of civil-military administrations in the occupied territories is an essential step towards maintaining stability and control in these areas. Having gained a foothold in these territories, we will be able to prevent the emergence of partisan activity and identify any accomplices of the Armed Forces of Ukraine."
 RUS_humanitarian_aid: "humanitarian aid"
 RUS_humanitarian_aid_desc: "Unfortunately, in some of the newly occupied territories, as a result of the fighting, people were left without access to electricity, water and gas. These difficult circumstances are a consequence of the conflict, and not the fault of the Ukrainian people. However, we will not leave these people to their fate. Instead, we will send them humanitarian aid to alleviate their suffering. We will provide them with the essentials, including food, water and heating equipment, they need now to survive in these difficult times."
 RUS_offensive_in_the_donbass: "Offensive in Donbass"
 RUS_offensive_in_the_donbass_desc: "Donbass is a region located in eastern Ukraine, which has become the birthplace of a conflict that has been going on for 8 years. During this time, the enemy has created a powerful line of defense in the region, deploying advanced weapons, artillery and the most experienced units. Despite this, it is important to plan our offensive, which will be able to break through their defenses and push them out of the region, finally stopping the shelling of the cities of Donbass."
 RUS_fast_assault: "Fast Assault"
 RUS_fast_assault_desc: "The sooner we liberate Ukraine, the sooner we will end the suffering of the Russian people in these lands and end the genocide. It is necessary to use all the means and resources that we have in order to break through the enemy's defenses. Even if it costs us many human sacrifices."
 RUS_accurate_promotion: "Accurate Promotion"
 RUS_accurate_promotion_desc: "Despite the difficult military situation in Ukraine, it is necessary to protect our human resources and military means in order not to cause unrest among our population, as well as to minimize the damage to civilians living in this region. Even if it takes months to capture the Donbass, we are ready to accept the fact that the enemy may have time to accumulate strength and strengthen other fronts. The Russian people have always been and remain a priority for us, and we are not going to turn them into cannon fodder."
 RUS_ahmat: "«Akhmat»"
 RUS_ahmat_desc: "Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, has at his disposal a special unit of the National Guard called “Akhmat”. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, the unit showed its high efficiency in the fight against terrorists in the North Caucasus, as well as great devotion and loyalty to our government. It is necessary to send it to the war zone in the hottest spots in order to achieve our success there."
 RUS_liberate_mariupol: "Liberate Mariupol"
 RUS_liberate_mariupol_desc: "Mariupol is a large city located on the northern coast of the Sea of Azov. It is of strategic importance due to its proximity to the Crimean peninsula and its status as a key transportation hub. The capture of Mariupol is necessary to gain control over the land corridor leading to the Crimea. However, it is important to approach any military action with caution and careful planning. The capture of Mariupol could potentially lead to a significant escalation of the conflict and lead to civilian casualties. It is important to take into account all possible risks and consequences, as well as to develop a coordinated strategy that minimizes harm to both the civilian population and our troops."
 RUS_preparation_of_landing_in_odessa: "Preparation of landing in Odessa"
 RUS_preparation_of_landing_in_odessa_desc: "Odessa is a large city located on the Black Sea coast in southern Ukraine. As one of the largest port cities in the country, it serves as the region's vital economic and cultural center. Likewise, Odessa also plays a key strategic role, serving as the gateway to the territory of Transnistria. For the successful conduct of the operation, it is extremely important to carefully prepare our marines for a possible landing in Odessa. In addition, we must carefully evaluate and decide on our overall strategy, taking into account factors such as the local landscape, weather conditions and potential threats from opposing forces."
